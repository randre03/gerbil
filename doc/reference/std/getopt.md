# Command Line Argument Parsing

This is the old name of the `:std/cli/getopt` module,
that provides facilities for command line argument parsing.

As of Gerbil v0.19 this name is deprecated and
you should be using the new library instead,
but the old name remains available for now
for the sake of backward compatibility.

::: tip usage
```scheme
(import :std/cli/getopt)
